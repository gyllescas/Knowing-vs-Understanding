<h1> Gabriel Yllescas's CS601 Concept</h1>

<p> After spending weeks working with a struggling 2nd grade student with common core math I have realized that visualizing the base 10 number system is something that kids really struggle with. I hope to build a learning tool to help visualize basic arithmetic operations + , -, *, /   </p>


<h2> Aproach</h2>
   <ul>
   	<li>
   		Parent enters homework problems.
   	</li>
   	<li>
   		A helpful character enters the application ready to <strong>walk the student through solving each problem</strong> 
   		<ul>
   			<li>
   				The base 10 number system is usually represented with blocks inside class rooms, but on homework assignments blocks are drawn in  in 2 dimensions.  I will find a javascript library to create 3d groups of blocks representing the one's, ten's, and hundred's place
   			</li>

   		</ul>

   	</li>
   	<li>
   		The <strong> student will set up the problem </strong> representing each number using blocks. For example 42 + 10 is 4 ten's and 2 one's + one ten. Only after completing this step will he be able to move on to solving the problem. 
   	</li>
   	<li>
   		A goal will also be for the student to be able to enter common core word problems. For example "What is one ten more than 4  tens and 2 one's"
   		<ul>
   			This part of the project might be extremely difficult. Writing a word paraser from scratch might be a stretch of a task. I will search for a javascript or a serverside php library to accomplish the parsing.
   		</ul>
   	</li>
   	<li>
   		A counter will keep track of the amount of time spent on the application and the success rate for each problem entered. 
   	</li>
   	<li>
   		On the server, logs of each session will be kept for teacher/parents to pin point exactly where a student struggles. 
   	</li>

   </ul>
